# Mission-to-Mars
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview ##
Honestly, although this full stack development was quite challenging, it was very intersting and I definitely look forward to
improving the finished product of this project.  I believe that I got a good grasp of dev tools and writing the code for the 
html file, but I will have to do some more work on bootstrap.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Challenges ##
I was able to produce the heading, Mars Fats, Mars Overview and Mars Featured Image.  However, I came across some challenges in
obtaining the Hemisphere images.  From the ipynb file, you will observe that I tried a number of options (that are commented out)
for pulling the Cerebrus Hemishpere image.  

I am not sure why the image is not being scraped to the html page because it is working when I run in on jupyter notebook. Probably
something is wrong with the griding of the html page.  Also I did explore the option of clicking Sample image, but this opens up a 
new web page and from this point I wasn't able to decipher how to get beautiful soup or browser to identify this new page in order 
to use this image.  The solution is probably very simple but due to time constraints I was unable to figure it out.  Will definitely
look into this in the near future.

I experimented in trying to pull the correct image before exploring the options of creating a for loop, but admittedly, this will be
the most efficient way to scrape the website.

## Assignment Success ##
1) Completed app.py
2) Completed scraping.py
3) Updated Mission_to_Mars.ipynb file
4) html page web scraping of Mars Facts, Mars News and Mars Featured Image was successful

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Incomplete Objectives ##
1) Started updating my GitHub html portfolio.  Still to be completed.
2) Commenced pulling Hemisphere images. Hit a snag in pulling the cerebrus hemishpere image.

## Key Takeaway Points ##
* Full stack development is very exciting and quite rewarding.  I think it can helpboost your reputation as coder or data analyst.
Obviously, once you can master this, the exciting part is actually building web sites and apps (that is when the real fun begins).

* It was quite interesing to see how many lines of code that go into just producing basic information on a web page.  I believe 
that this is a hyper learning field and one will get better with time.

* Full stack development can be tiring and frustrating.  Because there are so many moving parts in the entire process, one error
can throw off your results.
